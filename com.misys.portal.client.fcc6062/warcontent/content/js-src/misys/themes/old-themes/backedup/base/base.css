  		Base theme, extended by all other themes
  		
	description:
	  	The base theme describes the overall layout of the MTP application in terms of
	  	positioning, typography, HTML and Dijit overrides, portlet organisation and
	  	screen-specific CSS. All other themes extend base with their own colours, 
	  	fonts, backgrounds, positioning, etc.
	  	
	  	Base is organised into the following files
	  	
	  	- welcome.css          (Loaded by all unsecured pages)
	  	- base.css             (Loaded by all other pages)
	  	- common/document.css  (Typography presets, commonly used classes)
	  	- common/layout.css    (Row/Col layout, positioning, header/footer, menu)
	  	- common/portlets.css  (Portlet layout, definition of rules for Portlet Specification classes)
	  	- common/dijit.css     (Any overrides of core Dijit classes. Must be qualified with .base)
	  	- common/forms.css     (Styles for forms, for both edit and view modes)
	  	- common/screens.css   (Any screen-specific styles)
	  	
	  	Custom themes should override Base in the following way
	  	
	  	1. In portal.properties, set dojo.css.base.theme as follows
	  	
	  			dojo.css.base.theme = claro base
	  	
	  	2. Set dojo.css.theme to the name of your theme, e.g. myTheme
	  	
	  	3. Create the folder /js-src/misys/themes/myTheme
	  	
	  	4. Create the file welcome.css. Put all required Dijit imports at the top
	  	
	  	5.	Import "../base/welcome.css";
	  	
	  	6. Create the file myTheme.css. Put all your Dijit imports at the to
	  	
	  	7. Import "../base/base.css";
	  	
	  	8. If you need to override any rule in Base, create the corresponding CSS file in your
	  	   theme and add the new rule there, ensuring that you import it as needed in welcome.css
	  	   or myTheme.css. 
	  	   
	  	   For example, suppose I want to add a custom logo. The class .logo is found in 
	  	   	
	  	   		base/common/layout.css
	  	   
	  	   So I would create
	  	   
	  	   		/myTheme/common/layout.css
	  	   	
	  	   with my custom rule. 
	  	 
	  	 9. In welcome.css and myTheme.css, I would import "common/layout.css";
	  	  
	  	 7. If you need to override Dijit classes, you must qualify the override with the name
	  	    of your theme, which is set as a class on the <body> tag. E.g. 
	  	    
	  	    .myTheme .dijitDialog {
	  	    	// rule override
	  	    }
