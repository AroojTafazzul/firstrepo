    <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> consists of a set of modules
    (or functions) giving your company online access to various services
    offered by your bank. Each module provides options to initiate
    transactions and follow up with them. There are additional functions that
    provide enquiry, reporting and calendar management facilities.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">This <emphasis>Introduction</emphasis> chapter explains
    the basic concepts and terminology. The chapter <emphasis>Getting
    Started</emphasis> introduces the Web interface through which you use
    <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"

    <para role="TEXT">There is also one chapter for each of the general

    <title>Audience</title>

    <para role="TEXT">This manual is addressed to a user at a client's place,
    and describes the end-user functions in the client user interface.</para>
  </section>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Types of User</title>

    <para role="TEXT">A <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> system
    is used by two types of organisation: banks, and companies that are
    customers of banks. The latter are referred to as "customers" or
    "clients", with these terms being used interchangeably.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">The term "bank group" is used to refer to a site with
    overriding authority over the system, such as a bank's head office.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">A member of the staff of a client or bank is called a
    "user". A user with administrator privileges and permissions is called an
    "administrator".</para>

    <para role="TEXT">A <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> system
    has two different user interfaces: for a user at a client, and for a user
    at a bank or bank group.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Both interfaces include a menu of Services or System
    Features, containing functions for administering and configuring the
    <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> system. The rest of the
    interface contains end-user functions. The functions available to a given
    user depends on that user's privileges.</para>

    <title>Overview</title>

    <para role="TEXT">This section introduces the basic concepts and
    terminology used throughout <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>.</para>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Products and Transactions</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The financial products that a bank can provide, such
      as letters of credit, standby letters of credit, shipping guarantees,
      loans, and so on, are referred to as "products".</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The communications between bank and client about an
      individual instance of a product typically consist of a sequences of
      messages. For example, the communications regarding a letter of credit
      would typically consist of:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The client's initial request</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The bank's formal response</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">Possibly a request from the client to amend the
          request</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The bank's formal response to the amendment
          request</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">Possibly a free-format message from the client to
          the bank containing further discussion</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The bank's response to the free-format
          message</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">Possibly further free-format messages between the
          client and the bank</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para role="TEXT">These individual messages are called "transactions" or
      "transaction events". Those sent by the bank in reply to a client
      message are called "reporting messages" (because the bank is "reporting
      back" - they should not be confused with reports produced using the
      Report Designer module). The whole set of messages concerning one
      instance of a individual product is called a "file" (this represents a
      "file of documents" and should not be confused with the files that can
      be uploaded containing details of a transaction).</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The initial request from the client is often called
      the "initiation" of the file.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>System ID</title>

      <para role="TEXT">When a new file is created - for example, a client
      user creates a new Letter of Credit request - <xi:include
      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> gives it a unique reference
      number called its System ID. This is used throughout the system to
      identify it.</para>

            <imagedata fileref="../images/CLIENT_systemid.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject></para>

      <para role="TEXT">The System ID consists of a 2 character Product code
      describing the type of transaction, followed by the year and month and a
      unique number allocated to this transaction file.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The following table describes the products each

      <title>Permissions</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Which modules you, as an individual user, have access
      to, and what you can do in each module, depends on permissions granted
      you by your company's <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
      xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
      administrator. These permissions in turn have been granted to your
      company by the bank.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Your permissions are often referred to as privileges,
      authority or authorisation. These four terms are used
      interchangeably.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">These should not be confused with authentication,
      which means your login ID and password.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Workflow</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Many functions in <xi:include
      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> follow much the same
      pattern. As a client user, you send a request to the bank on behalf of
      your company. As an example, this might be a request for a Letter of
      Credit or a request for a drawdown on a loan. The bank replies with a
      message acknowledging the request, and approving or rejecting it.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Further messages can be sent to the bank, discussing
      or amending the request.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When the bank's reply (reporting message) arrives, it
      is shown in the Recent Notifications list in the Trade Events portlet on
      the home pages of the company's users. It has a tick if the bank has
      approved the transaction, and a cross if the bank has declined the
      transaction.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">There are also functions that display lists of these
      transactions, so their progress can be monitored.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When creating a transaction, it can be saved at any
      time , without sending it, and can be continued by the original or
      another user at a later stage. Its status will be marked as 'Draft' or
      'Incomplete', depending on the type of transaction, and the list being
      viewed.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When a transaction is submitted (sent to the bank, it
      may be that the user submitting the transaction has insufficient
      authority to do so - usually because of a transactional value limit. It
      is then automatically saved but not sent and given a status of
      'Unsigned' or 'Uncontrolled' depending on the type of transaction, and
      the list being viewed. It must then be submitted by another user with
      the appropriate authorities required to send it.</para>
