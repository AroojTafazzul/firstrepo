  <para role="TEXT">This document provides an in-depth description of <xi:include
  href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> for users at a client site.
  <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> gives your company online
  access to loan services arranged with your bank. It provides functions to
  initiate transactions and follow up with them.</para>

  <para role="TEXT">This <emphasis>Introduction</emphasis> chapter explains the basic
  concepts and terminology. The chapter Loan Module gives an overview of the
  module followed by a detailed description of each function. A function
  generally corresponds to a menu item. A detailed description of any Web
  pages (typically lists and input forms) displayed by the function is given,
  explaining the use of each field.</para>

  <para role="TEXT">In every reporting popup , you can export the details of any
  transaction to a PDF format by clicking the button <inlinemediaobject>

    <title>Types of User</title>

    <para role="TEXT">A <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> system is used by two types
    of organisation: banks, and companies that are customers of banks. We
    refer to the latter as "customers" or "clients" - we use these two terms
    interchangeably.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">In addition, we use the term "bank group" to mean a site with
    overriding authority over the system, such as a bank's head office.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">A member of the staff of a client or bank is called a "user". A user
    with administrator privileges is called an "administrator".</para>

    <para role="TEXT">A <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> system has two different
    user interfaces: for a user at a client, and for a user at a bank or bank
    group.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Both interfaces have a section called System Features, containing
    functions for administering and configuring the <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> system. The rest of the
    interface contains end-user functions. Which functions are available to a
    given user depends on that user's privileges.</para>
  </section>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Audience</title>

    <para role="TEXT">This manual is addressed to a user at a client, and describes the
    end-user functions in the client user interface.</para>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para role="TEXT">This section introduces the basic terminology used throughout
    <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />.</para>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Products and Transactions</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The financial products that a bank can provide, such as letters of
      credit, standby letters of credit, shipping guarantees, loans, and so
      on, are referred to as "products".</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The communications between bank and client about an individual
      instance of a product typically consist of a sequences of messages. For
      example, the communications regarding a loan would consist of the
      client's initial request, the bank's formal response, possibly some
      free-format messages containing further discussion, and possibly some
      further responses from the bank.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">These individual messages are called "transactions" or
      "transaction events". Those sent by the bank in reply to a client
      message are called "reporting messages" (because the bank is "reporting
      back"). The whole set of messages concerning one instance of a
      individual product is called a "file" (this represents a "file of
      documents" and should not be confused with the files that can be
      uploaded containing details of a transaction).</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The initial request from the client is often called the
      "initiation" of the file.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>System ID</title>

      <para role="TEXT">When a new file is created - for example, a client user creates a
      new loan request - <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
      xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> gives
      it a unique reference number called its System ID. This is used
      throughout the system to identify it.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Permissions</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Which functions you, as an individual user, have access to,
      depends on permissions granted you by your company's <xi:include
      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> administrator. These
      permissions in turn have been granted to your company by the
      bank.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Your permissions are often referred to as privileges, authority or
      authorisation. These four terms are used interchangeably.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">These should not be confused with authentication, which means your
      login ID and password.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Workflow</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The typical workflow is as follow. As a client user, you send a
      request to the bank on behalf of your company, for a drawdown on a loan.
      The bank replies with a message acknowledging the request , and
      approving or rejecting it.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">You can then send further messages to the bank, discussing or
      amending your request.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When the bank's reply (reporting message) arrives, it is shown in
      the Last Notifications list in the Trade Events portlet on the home
      pages of your company's users. It has a tick if the bank has approved
      the transaction, and a cross if the bank has declined the
      transaction.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">There are also functions that display lists of these transactions,
      so you can monitor their progress.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When you are creating a transaction, you can save it at any time ,
      without sending it, so that you or another user can work on it later.
      Its status is called Draft. On some lists it is called
      Incomplete.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When you try to send a transaction ("submit" it), you might find
      that you have insufficient authority to do so - usually because you
      don't have the authority to handle the amount of money involved. It is
      then automatically saved but not sent, so that another user with greater
      authority can send it. This status is called Unsigned. On some lists it
      is called Uncontrolled.</para>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Date and Amount Formats</title>

    <para role="TEXT">When entering a date in a date field, two formats are available. You
    can enter it in the form <replaceable>DD/MM/YYYY</replaceable> or
    <replaceable>DDMMYY</replaceable> if your locale is for instance France,
    or in the form <replaceable>MM/DD/YYYY</replaceable> or
    <replaceable>MMDDYY</replaceable> if your locale is for instance the
    USA..</para>

    <para role="TEXT"><informalexample>
        <para role="TEXT">For example, entering <literal moreinfo="none">180401</literal>
        produces a display of <literal moreinfo="none">18/04/2001</literal>,
        which in a French locale corresponds to 18th April 2001.</para>
      </informalexample></para>

    <para role="TEXT">When you enter an amount, the system automatically formats the value
    entered according to the currency selected. You can either enter the
    amount using the decimal and group delimiters of your locale (for example,
    respectively [,] and [space] for France, or [.] and [,] for Singapore), or
    directly as a series of digits.</para>

    <para role="TEXT"><informalexample>
        <para role="TEXT">For example, <literal moreinfo="none">123456.00</literal> in a
        Singaporean locale produces a display of <literal
        moreinfo="none">123,456.00</literal> if the currency involved is
        associated with 2 decimal places.</para>
      </informalexample></para>
  </section>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Lists</title>

    <para role="TEXT">Many functions display a page that lists relevant records. These
    list pages have some things in common:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
           You can enter search criteria in a group of fields at the top of the page and click Search, to make the list show only records that match these criteria. These fields represent the most important fields in the record, as do the columns in the table. 
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
           You can use wildcards in these fields. The wildcard character is an asterisk (*). You can use it anywhere in a field. 
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">On pages where the list might be very long - for example, if
          there are many transactions - the list is not displayed until you
          have entered the search criteria and clicked <emphasis
          role="bold">Search</emphasis>. Enter an asterisk in any of the
          search fields to get the entire list.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
           If your company has entities defined in its profile, then a 

          <guilabel />

           column and a search criterion field for 

          <emphasis role="bold">Entity</emphasis>

           appear in addition to the columns and fields mentioned in the individual descriptions below. 
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">You can click the triangular icons in the heading of a column
          to sort the display on that column in ascending or descending
          order.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">There may be a column where you can click to open the
          individual record for viewing or editing. These are described in the
          sections for the individual functions.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Descriptions of Forms</title>

    <para role="TEXT">Most functions display online forms for you to fill in. This
    documentation describes each such form in detail, with a table describing
    each control (field, button, etc). The middle column in these tables
    contains symbols showing what type each control is, as follows:</para>
