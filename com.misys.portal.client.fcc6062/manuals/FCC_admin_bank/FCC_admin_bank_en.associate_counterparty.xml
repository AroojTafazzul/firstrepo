  <title>Associate Counterparty with Customer</title>

  <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Data Maintenance &gt;
  Counterparties</emphasis> function on the Trade Administration menu (click
  <emphasis role="bold">Middle-Office</emphasis> on your main menu to open
  this) maintains a list of companies that your bank deals with - for example,
  when creating an Export LC notification, a user at your bank fills in the
  beneficiary field by selecting a company from this list. These companies are
  called counterparties.</para>

  <para>Similarly, users at a client company can create and maintain a list of
  counterparties that their company deals with. A client administrator who has
  the <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Collaboration_S"
  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> enabled can, in defining a new
  counterparty, create a login ID for that counterparty. This enables users at
  the counterparty to connect to <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
  xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> to see
  tasks assigned to them.</para>

  <para>If you, as a bank administrator, have the <xi:include
  href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Collaboration_S"
  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/> enabled, you can associate
  counterparties created by one client with other clients as well. This
  enables these other clients to deal with the counterparty too. Moreover, any
  initiation of a trade product is immediately notified to the counterparty.
  For example, when an initiation of <application>Import Letter of
  Credit</application> is validated by the Issuing Bank, it is immediately
  advised to the beneficiary as an <application>Export Letter of
  Credit</application>.</para>

  <para>You do this using <emphasis role="bold">Customer Maintenance &gt;
  Associate Counterparty(ies) With Customer</emphasis> on the System Features
  menu.</para>

  <para>When you select this option, you are presented with a list of clients
  and their counterparties.</para>

  <para>You can select which entries are shown, by entering search criteria in
  the <emphasis role="bold">Entity</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">Customer
  Abbreviated Name</emphasis>, <guilabel moreinfo="none"> Customer

  Name</emphasis>, and/or <guilabel moreinfo="none">Counterparty
  Name</guilabel> fields. You can use wildcards in these fields.</para>
