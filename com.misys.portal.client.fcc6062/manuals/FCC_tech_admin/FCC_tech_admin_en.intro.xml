    <para>This document aims at guiding a system administrator throughout the
    parameterisation and administration of <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
    xpointer="ent_appli" /> for a typical deployment environment.</para>

    <para>The document initially provides an in-depth description of the
    application properties set-up, specially addressing the key parameters
    that must be correctly and carefully set-up to ensure the correct
    behaviour of <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xpointer="ent_appli" />, and
    additional parameters already set-up in the default configuration that
    could be of some use in order to implement a specific behaviour.</para>

    <para><xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xpointer="ent_appli" /> is
    delivered as a configured package that includes some default database
    data, fully described in a dedicated chapter: part of them are mandatory
    system data, others are default set-up proposed in order to ease the
    initial deployment and user administration tasks.</para>

    <para><xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xpointer="ent_appli" /> itself
    requires very low effort in terms of maintenance, mostly relying on the
    application server stability and overall capabilities (you may refer to
    the installation guide for the application server set-up). All application
    logs are generated in a unique specific output file, following coding
    rules. In order to ease the system's administration, the traces format is
    presented in this document, and the trapped errors listed in a dedicated
    annex, together with a corresponding proposed actions that the system
    administrator should undertake when encountering any issue.</para>
