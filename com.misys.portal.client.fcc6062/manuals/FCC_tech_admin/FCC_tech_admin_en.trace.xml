    requires very low effort in terms of maintenance, mostly relying on the
    application server administrative features.</para>

    <para>All application logs are generated in a unique specific output file,
    conforming to the naming conventions presented here. You may also refer to
    the annex that lists the errors trapped, together with a set of proposed
    actions that the system administrator should undertake when encountering
    them.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Traces Format</title>

    <para>All messages raised in the log file follow the following
    format:</para>

    <para><replaceable>[Date]</replaceable> -- ERROR --
    <replaceable>Module</replaceable> <replaceable> + '</replaceable>
    <replaceable>-</replaceable> <replaceable>' + </replaceable>
    <replaceable>Description</replaceable> <replaceable> + </replaceable>
    <replaceable>Additional</replaceable> error traces eventually
    concatenated.</para>

    <programlisting format="linespecific">[lun. d√©c. 02 12:51:51 CET] -- ERROR -- com.neomalogic.gtp.common.localization.Localization - Id is f071ccea-0a0a0a05-01a5ba75-0a302324, message is :ORACLE ERROR 345 Impossible to connect to database.</programlisting>

    <para>The Error Number is a unique ID split in 4 sections of 8
    characters.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Error Message Display</title>

    <para>When <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xpointer="ent_appli" />
    encounters an error, an error message with a unique ID is displayed to
    offer maximum hints about it, so that he can eventually contact to the
    technical administrator.</para>

    <para>The message format is almost identical to the traces' one, though it
    is displayed with three lines.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The first line shows a localised message meaningful to the user,
      whereas the others lines are understandable to the technical
      administrator.</para>
