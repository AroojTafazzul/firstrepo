  <title>Reporting Edition Module</title>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para role="TEXT">The features gathered under the term of Reporting are related to the
    actions taken by a bank playing an active role in a Trade Finance
    transaction existing in <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xpointer="ent_appli" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> as a
    product record.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">All the products (Import and Export Letters of Credit, Shipping
    Guarantees, Financing Requests, Export and Import Documentary Collections,
    Banker's Guarantees, Issued and Received Standby LCs, Fund Transfers and
    Inward Remittances) available in the system can be manipulated within the
    Reporting Edition module, and the bank's actions on these records can be
    split in three categories:</para>

    <para role="TEXT"><emphasis role="strong">Reply to an initiation submitted to the bank
    by one of its customers</emphasis>. Under the term initiation, we
    understand all the new events on any product representing a new
    transactional communication from the client to the bank. As examples, it
    will typically include the request for issuance of a new Letter of Credit,
    a new amendment of its terms, the creation of a new Guarantee, a new
    Financing Request, the delivery of new collection instructions by a drawer
    to his remitting bank or for instance any update on the products supported
    through the free format message transaction event.</para>

    <para role="TEXT"><emphasis role="strong">Creation of a new Reporting message on an
    existing transaction record</emphasis> <emphasis
    role="strong">.</emphasis> As opposed to the previous one, this
    communication is initiated by the bank handling the record and used to
    notify the customer of a new event that has occurred on his transaction.
    An example could be for the issuing bank of a Letter of Credit to send an
    advice of discrepancies to the importer when the documents have been
    received from the negotiating bank, or alternatively to trace its customer
    for the payment of a sight bill under an LC.</para>

    <para role="TEXT"><emphasis role="strong">Creation by the bank of a completely new
    transaction record</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">.</emphasis> This is
    available for the notification to the export customer of a new Export
    Letter of Credit (Commercial or Standby) issued in his favour, or the
    notification to a client of a new Import Documentary Collection for which
    it is the designated drawee.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Each of those categories represents an option appearing as a menu
    item of the <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
    xpointer="ent_Middle_Office" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
    screen, that can itself be reached from the bank user's home page.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Note that for each type of reporting, the capability of introducing
    several users to validate the message sent back to the customer is
    available. This feature allows the bank to set up an authorisation matrix
    for its users to implement a four-eyes principle or a jurisdiction based
    on the amounts reported.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">This mechanism is the same as the one available on the customer side
    to control several levels of controls on the transaction
    submissions.</para>
  </section>

  <section role="ITEM">
    <title>Export as an Acrobat PDF format</title>

    <para role="TEXT">For all the products, in every reporting popup , the user can export
    the details of any transaction to an <type>Acrobat PDF</type> format by
    clicking on the button <inlinemediaobject>

    <title>Pending Records</title>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The pending records seen from the bank standpoint are the
      transaction events which have been successfully submitted to the bank by
      its customers. Those are records now waiting for an acknowledgement by
      the bank's Trade Services which has to decide if the related requests
      can be approved and hence processed in the back-office operations of the
      bank.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">As long as a pending record has not been approved by the bank
      through this <guisubmenu>reporting</guisubmenu> option, the record is
      not seen as <type>Existing</type> (in case it is a creation of
      transaction), <type>Amended</type> or <type>Updated</type> on the client
      side. In other words, its new or updated details have not been committed
      to the master expression of this transaction record as long as the
      acknowledgement has not been applied.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The mechanism of generation of the reply and the associated
      workflow for the bank user is the following:</para>

      <orderedlist continuation="restarts" inheritnum="ignore"
                   numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The bank user reviews the list of such pending records whether
          from his home page or from the consolidated list.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The user selects a record by clicking on its <xi:include
          href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> assigned reference
          number to see more details than the summary appearing in the
          list.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">An input form is returned with the following
          capabilities:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para role="TEXT">The user can review the details of the event as well as
              the full details of the transaction itself. He can print or
              export these details as a PDF format and leave the form for now
              if some processing / validation is required in the back-office
              before being able to generate the acknowledgement
              message.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para role="TEXT">After reviewing the details, and eventually after the
              back-office has processed the request, the first part of the
              reporting form lets the bank user enter the text details of the
              message that will be sent as an acknowledgement to the customer
              together with eventual attachments.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <note>
        <para role="TEXT">If the electronic details of the transaction record need to be
        altered as a consequence of the processing by the back-office (for
        instance after some additional modifications were provided by the user
        through the phone), it is advised to convey these modifications in a
        subsequent reporting message (incepted from the <guimenuitem
        moreinfo="none">Existing Records</guimenuitem> menu item). Indeed, it
        will keep the consistency between the data of the back-office and the
        kind of file that will be displayed to the customer as part of his
        reporting. And since it is an additional reporting message, the
        customer still has access in the history of the transaction to the
        original details he has submitted as well as the updated view provided
        by the bank through the second message.</para>
      </note>

      <para role="TEXT">The following sections will detail the various interfaces provided
      to the bank user for these steps.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>List Pending Records</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The list of pending records that the bank user can access to
      review the items pending for the bank's acknowledgement and eventually
      add the required reporting message can be inquired from two different
      places in <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">Since these transactional messages are among the most urgent
          things for a bank user to consider in order to provide the customer
          with a fast response to his business requests, the home page of
          <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> for all bank users is
          showing in its top portion a list of the most recent transaction
          records received from their customers. In its principle, this list
          is quite similar to the Trade Events component available on the home
          page of the client users to remind them of any outstanding
          transactions or the recent notifications sent by the bank. In order
          to avoid a too long display within the home page of the bank user,
          the list is limited by default to 10 items, and this number can be
          parameterised through the relevant properties file. Each element in
          the list can be clicked on to rapidly open the reporting form and
          show its full details.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">The <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml"
          xpointer="ent_Middle_Office"
          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> screen is the place to
          go to if the complete list of pending records needs to be inquired.
          It can be accessed from the <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Pending
          Records</guimenuitem> menu item and its <guilabel>List of
          Records</guilabel> sub-section.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para role="TEXT">The latter list is also offering additional features in terms of
      filters since the search can be adjusted to return only a given set of
      pending transaction records.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The fields available to adjust the search pattern are the
      <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> assigned <guilabel
      moreinfo="none">System Id</guilabel> number of the transaction record,
      the <guilabel moreinfo="none">abbreviated name</guilabel> of the
      customers' Company, and eventually the <guilabel
      moreinfo="none">Product</guilabel> (any of the ones offering an input
      capability on the client side). Wildcards can be used for these fields
      to broaden the scope of the search.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Once a bank user has already started to work on a pending record
      and has whether saved it or already tried a submission, this record will
      not appear in this list anymore but instead in the <guisubmenu>Retrieve
      Draft</guisubmenu> or <guisubmenu>Retrieve Unsigned</guisubmenu>
      sub-menu items.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The columns returned in the list of Pending Records are the

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para role="TEXT">For various reasons throughout the life of an International Trade
      transaction, the bank handling the file (typically as the issuing bank
      of an LC, SI, SG, TF or FT transaction, the recipient or issuing bank
      for a BG, the advising bank for an EL, SR, the remitting bank for an EC
      or IR or the presenting for an IC) may need to send various
      transactional messages to its customers.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">A typical usage of this feature would be the capability for the
      bank to notify the exporter of an amendment on a Export Letter of Credit
      notified previously in his favour, or for example to forward an advice
      of discrepancies to the applicant of an Import Letter of Credit.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">More generally, the bank can use the generation of reporting from
      an existing record each time it needs to send a message to the customer
      and when this event is not a reply to something initiated by the client
      (in which case it would be accessed through the <application>Pending
      Records</application> module).</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The flow to create these events is similar to the one described
      for that previous module. And in particular, the concept of
      authorisation and Save/Submit stages also applies.</para>

      <title>List Existing Records</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The bank user is provided with a search screen to easily access
      the transaction record that requires to be updated under the reporting.
      This screen is initially blank and only displays a search form. Since
      the consolidated list of existing transaction records for all products

      initially requested to adjust the search criteria before submitting his

      <para role="TEXT"><emphasis role="strong">The third section</emphasis> that can be

      details of the file for which an event is currently prepared.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Due to its impact on potentially the whole set of data

      ensuring that the customer will electronically receive a fully updated

      <para role="TEXT">Compared to the two previous options, the Export Notification is
      dedicated to a single product and a single type of event: the goal of
      this feature is to provide the user of the bank acting as the advising
      bank in a Letter of Credit transaction with a front-end to create new
      Export Letter of Credit notifications to his customers (which are
      therefore the beneficiaries of the LC).</para>

      <para role="TEXT">In order to offer a consistent interface with a straight learning
      curve for the bank user, the principles of this front-end are similar to

    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Free Format</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Since the terms of an Export Letter of Credit received from the
      issuing bank are often expressed as a large text, or typically under the
      form of a unstructured letter, the <guisubmenu>Free Format</guisubmenu>
      option is introduced to let the bank user notify such free format
      instructions to his customer. The core of the form available when
      selecting this option is therefore a large narrative text field.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Retrieve Draft</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The option <guisubmenu>Retrieve Draft</guisubmenu> is displaying a
      list of all the new Export Notifications which have already been
      prepared and saved by the bank input user, but whether not completed or
      simply not submitted back to the customer because of a lack of
      authorisation in the profile of this potential submitter.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The list presented to the user is displaying all such records. The
      same search criteria are presented to the bank user and the same columns
      are returned as for the two previous types of reporting.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Retrieve Unsigned</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The option <guisubmenu>Retrieve Unsigned</guisubmenu> is returning
      a list of all the new Export Notifications that have been completed
      internally but not yet submitted back to the customer because of a lack
      of authorisation in the bank user's profile.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The same option and results as the ones described for the other
      types of reporting are available for this list.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">For the user holding the appropriate permission in his profile,
      the list also offers the capability to perform the submission of
      multiple records in a single operation. For that purpose, a check box is
      available with each record of the list and a button at the end of the
      screen triggers the submission of all the selected records.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The result of the action is then returned to the user with the
      list of items which have been successfully sent to the customer, next to
      the list of the records pending from an additional validation. The
      updated list of unsigned records is then also displayed.</para>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para role="TEXT">This option is very similar to the one dedicated to the Export
      Letter of Credit and described in the previous chapter.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Its goal is to provide the user of the bank acting as the advising
      bank in a Standby Letter of Credit transaction with a front-end to
      create new Standby LC notifications to his customers who are the
      beneficiaries of the Standby LC received (SR).</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The various ways to perform the initiation of the Standby LC are
      the following.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Standard</title>

      <para role="TEXT">This <guisubmenu>Standard</guisubmenu> option provides the bank
      user with a form similar to the one obtained with the <guisubmenu>From
      Scratch</guisubmenu> option on a new Export Letter of Credit: the
      details of the Standby LC notification are entered in a blank form with
      structured fields dedicated to Letter of Credit details.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Free Format</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Since the terms of a Standby Letter of Credit received from the
      issuing bank are often expressed as a large text, or typically under the
      form of a unstructured letter, the <guisubmenu>Free Format</guisubmenu>
      option is introduced to let the bank user notify such free format
      instructions to his customer. The core of the form available when
      selecting this option is therefore a large narrative text field.</para>
    </section>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Retrieve Draft</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The option <guisubmenu>Retrieve Draft</guisubmenu> is displaying a
      list of all the new Standby LC notifications which have already been
      prepared and saved by the bank input user, but whether not completed or
      simply not submitted back to the customer because of a lack of
      authorisation in the profile of this potential submitter.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The list presented to the user is displaying all such records. The
      same search criteria are presented to the bank user and the same columns
      are returned as for the previous types of reporting.</para>

      <title>Retrieve Unsigned</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The option <guisubmenu>Retrieve Unsigned</guisubmenu> is returning
      a list of all the new Standby LC notifications that have been completed
      internally but not yet submitted back to the customer because of a lack
      of authorisation in the bank user's profile.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The same option and results as the ones described for the other
      types of reporting are available for this list.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">For the user holding the appropriate permission in his profile,
      the list also offers the capability to perform the submission of
      multiple records in a single operation. For that purpose, a check box is
      available with each record of the list and a button at the end of the
      screen triggers the submission of all the selected records.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The result of the action is then returned to the user with the
      list of items which have been successfully sent to the customer, next to
      the list of the records pending from an additional validation. The

    <title>Issued Standby Letter of Credit Form</title>

    <section role="ITEM">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para role="TEXT">Even if it is based on a flow of documents often related to a
      business transaction between a buyer and seller, the Standby Letter of
      Credit is not specifically related to the movement of goods.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">It acts more like a guarantee and it therefore allows the
      beneficiary to receive a payment from the issuing bank in the event of
      default on a contract, provided that the complying documents (usually a
      sight draft) are presented. A Standby LC can be governed whether by the
      UCP 500 rules or the more specific ISP 98 practices.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The Issued Standby LC focuses on the applicant side and is
      therefore very similar to the Import Letter of Credit seen previously.
      The key difference is that it can also be issued through a fairly
      unstructured form providing a large text area for the client to enter
      the details of the requested Standby LC.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">When the bank edits a reporting message on this product, the form
      will automatically inherits from the one used for its original issuance:
      if the Standby LC was initiated through a standard form, the same form
      as for an Import LC is displayed; if it was issued as a set of free
      format terms, the related form is loaded.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The following chapters focus on that <guisubmenu>free
      format</guisubmenu> option. For further details on the structured form,
      you may refer to the <olink targetdoc="GTP_user_bank"

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para role="TEXT">The Export Letter of Credit actually refers to the same product as
      the Import Letter of Credit described above, but seen from a different
      point of view. The key difference resides in the role that the bank is
      playing in the processing of the file:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">When the product manipulated within <xi:include
          href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> is an Import Letter of
          Credit (LC), it means that the current bank is the issuing bank of
          the transaction. The client of this LC is called the applicant or
          importer.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para role="TEXT">When the product record is an Export Letter of Credit (EL), it
          means that the bank is the advising the bank of this documentary
          credit and its client is called the beneficiary or the exporter.
          Prior to initiating an EL record within <xi:include
          href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
          xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />, the bank has
          typically received the Letter of Credit under the form of a
          <type>SWIFT</type>, <type>Telex</type> or <type>Courier</type>
          message from the issuing bank.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para role="TEXT">Due to these similarities, the form dedicated to the EL product
      and described below is quite similar to the one related to the LC
      product.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">This form containing the business details of the Letter of Credit
      notification sent to the beneficiary can be accessed from the
      <application moreinfo="none">Edit Transaction Details</application>
      feature found in the reporting page of the Existing Records when the
      product record edited is an EL, or through the <guisubmenu>Export
      Notification</guisubmenu> option when a new EL needs to be
      notified.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The Received Standby LC is for the Issued Standby LC what the
      Export Letter of Credit is to the Import LC: it focuses on the
      beneficiary's side of the transaction and the bank plays the role of its
      advising bank, creating the record through the initial notification
      phase to the customer.</para>

      is the same as for the Export Letter of Credit, except for the Standby

      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"

      used in international trade whereby the exporter entrusts the handling
      of trade documents to banks and gives the banks instructions concerning
      the release of these documents to the importer.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The Export Documentary Collection refers to the export side of

      user to optionally generate and submit to his customer the actual cover
      letter that he will use to send directly the documents to the presenting
      bank. This method circumvents a classical flaw of the direct collections
      whereby the remitting bank is reluctant to provide its customer with
      blank forms bearing its letterhead without any control on them.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The built-in flow for the generation and attachment of the cover

    <title>Fund Transfer Product</title>

    <para role="TEXT">The Fund Transfer product is a simple Cash Management feature
    available in <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> to let the customer enter
    the details of a fund transfer request, for which the bank can
    subsequently send an acknowledgement upon successful completion. It comes
    with two built-in types: <type>Internal</type> which is typically used
    when funds need to be transferred between two accounts of the same
    company, and <type>Outgoing</type> when an external beneficiary needs to
    be specified as the recipient of the fund transfer together with an
    eventual banking institution acting as an intermediary.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Compared to the other products handled by the <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />, the <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Fund_T"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> module is associated with a
    single event (the submission of the transfer request and the bank's
    reply), and hence the bank does not need to specifically interact with its
    details for further reporting.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Therefore the bank side of the Fund Transfer product is limited to a
    review of the instructions sent by the client and the interaction is
    limited to the common input fields available for every reporting message
    generated by the bank from a pending customer request. You may refer to
    the chapter detailing this common function for further details.</para>
