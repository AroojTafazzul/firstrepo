    <title>Overview</title>

    <para role="TEXT">The <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Customer_RM"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> (CRM) module constitutes the
    bank side of the CRM features available in <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> and found on the client side
    in the <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Business_R"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> module. It gives a user at a
    client an electronic channel of communication with the Trade Services team
    of all the banks his or her company is entitled to liase with through the
    portal.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">This module is primarily for non-transactional requests (for
    transactions, the appropriate Product module and function should rather be
    used), and typically provides a way for a user at a client company to
    submit questions such as requests for quotes on specific services to a
    bank's trade team.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">The organisation of this simple knowledge base is similar to a
    database of Frequently Asked Questions. You have access to domains
    representing each relationship your bank has with client companies within
    <xi:include href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />. These contain folders,
    which in turn contain topics with sets of questions and answers.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <para role="TEXT">For example , imagine your bank (whose abbreviated name is
      <literal moreinfo="none">Bank1</literal>) has registered two of its
      customers (<literal moreinfo="none">Company1</literal> and <literal
      moreinfo="none">Company2</literal>), granting them access to <xi:include
      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_appli"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> and its CRM features. You
      therefore have access to two domains - for communicating with these two
      companies.</para>

      <para role="TEXT">Therefore, when you access the initial <xi:include
      href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_Customer_RM"
      xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /> screen, you are presented
      with a list of all the domains your bank has accessed to. In the
      situation described here, two domains will appear: <literal
      moreinfo="none">Bank1 - Company1</literal>, and <literal
      moreinfo="none">Bank1 - Company2</literal>. </para>

      <para role="TEXT">Within each domain, questions and answers are organised by
      folders. A typical folder could for instance be called <literal>Importer
      Area</literal>, to address concerns specific to importers. One level
      deeper, the topics organise the information within one folder, and each
      of them contains a set of questions and answers.</para>
    </informalexample>

    <para role="TEXT">It is up to the users at the bank to create and organise the folders
    and topics. Client users can browse or search through the existing folders
    and topics, and submit new questions which will immediately become visible
    to the users at the appropriate bank. As a bank user, your main task in
    this module is to browse through the database of existing questions and
    answers, and to answer the pending questions.</para>

    <title>Using CRM</title>

    <para role="TEXT">When you click <emphasis role="bold">Customer Relationship
    Management</emphasis>, you are presented with a list of domains available
    to your bank. Click the one for the company whose questions you want to
    see.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Alternatively you can click <emphasis role="bold">Search</emphasis>
    to search for questions containing a given text, or <emphasis
    role="bold">List Unanswered</emphasis> for a list of all questions that
    users at the selected company have submitted but that have not yet been
    answered. These two functions are available on every page in <xi:include
    href="../entities_en.xml" xpointer="ent_CRM"
    xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Having selected a domain, you then get a list of folders in that
    domain. This page also has an <emphasis role="bold">Add New
    Folder</emphasis> function. To create a folder, click this link, type a
    name for the folder, and click <emphasis role="bold">Save</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para role="TEXT">Each folder in the list has a <emphasis
    role="bold">Modify</emphasis> link beside it. Click this to get a page
    where you can delete or rename the folder.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Click a folder in the list to get a tree view showing the topics in
    that folder, and the questions within the topics. Each question is
    followed by a number showing how may answers the bank has posted for it.
    This page also has an <emphasis role="bold">Add New Topic</emphasis>
    function. To create a topic, click this link, type a name for the topic,
    and click <emphasis role="bold">Save</emphasis>. </para>

    <para role="TEXT">Click a question in the tree view to see the full question and its
    answers.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Alternatively, click a topic in the tree view to get a tree view
    showing just that topic and the questions within it. From this
    single-topic view (and from no other) you get an additional function
    <emphasis role="bold">Add New Question</emphasis>. You can use this to add
    questions other than those sent in by client users. To add a question,
    click this function, type your question, and click <emphasis
    role="bold">Save</emphasis>.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Your question is immediately added to the database and so is
    accessible to users both at your bank and at the company corresponding to
    the selected domain. It is also brought to the attention of users at your
    bank by appearing in the list of Trade Recent Requests on their home
    pages</para>

    <para role="TEXT">Also at the bottom of this single-topic tree view is a <emphasis
    role="bold">Modify this Topic</emphasis> function. Click this to get a
    page where you can delete or rename the topic.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">On the page that shows a question and its answers, click <emphasis
    role="bold">Add New Answer</emphasis> to add an answer. Alternatively,
    click <emphasis role="bold">Modify</emphasis> by the question or by an
    answer to get a page where you can edit or delete it. The page where you
    enter or edit an answer includes facilities enabling you to format what
    you type - you can specify font, font-size, and colour, insert links and
    images, and so on.</para>

    <para role="TEXT">At the top of each page in your tree view is a toolbar (sometimes
    called a breadcrumb trail) showing where in the tree you currently are.
    You can move back up the tree by clicking in this toolbar.</para>
