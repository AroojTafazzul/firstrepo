  <title>Trade Middle-Office Module</title>

  <para role="TEXT">The Document Presentations issued by the customers are gathered under
  the <application>Trade Middle-Office</application> module, so that the bank
  can reply by acknowledging or rejecting the presentation.</para>

  <para role="TEXT">The document presentations initially received appear in the List of
  Pending Records. Once a bank user has already started to work on the
  presentation and has either saved it or tried a submission, this record will
  not appear in this list anymore but instead in the <guisubmenu>Retrieve
  Draft</guisubmenu> or <guisubmenu>Retrieve Unsigned</guisubmenu> sub-menu
  items.</para>

  <para role="TEXT">This flow follows the classic reporting mechanism described in the
  <emphasis role="strong">Bank User Guide</emphasis>.</para>

  <para role="TEXT"><emphasis role="strong">Remark</emphasis>: acknowledgment or rejection
  is the only action available to the bank to respond to a Document
  Presentation. Indeed these presentations are always issued by the customers,
  and there won't be any further amendments or messages issued on a
  presentation:</para>

      <para role="TEXT">The presentations therefore won't appear in the lists of existing
      records</para>

    <listitem>
      <para role="TEXT">There is no specific menu for the document presentation, as there
      is for some other products.</para>
